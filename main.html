	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	 <p>
        As developers, we are constructing new things every day. Each line of code is another building block. We’re watching our product evolve with each feature. In a way, we’re not engineers, we’re builders. There’s something very satisfying about creating something new.
        For better or worst, programming involves endless learning. Every day you get to work with a new framework, see some new code, learn a new API, etc. This process of self-improvement is very gratifying. Every day you’re a bit smarter than the day before. Comparing this to a video game, you’re gaining experience points and levels with each new thing you learn.
